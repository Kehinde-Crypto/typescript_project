Situations: 
do not over use typeScript
let userId:number
number = 12345
the any key word: and that is not a good practice
any avoids type checking errors is not a special type it is a maker but it is not doing the makers
noImplicitlyAny
# THE MAJOR OBJECTIVE IS TO MAKE THE TYPES MORE STRICT
it must be strick and be able to write the code effectively
# THE DIFFERNCE BETWEEN TYPES ALIAS AND INTERFACE 
# THE TYPE CANNOT BE RE-OPENDED TO ADD NEW PROPETIES  AND THE INTERFACE WHICH IS ALWAYS EXTENDABLE
interface Bear extends Animal {
  honey:boolean
}
type Bear = Animal and {
  honey:boolean
}
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE
Please explain is code
// class Identity {
//  public email:string
//   name:string
// readonly city:string = "" // it is because it is not inside the constructor
//   constructor(email:string, name:string) {
//     this.email = email;
//     this.name = name
//   }
// }
// const identity = new Identity ("k@gmail.com","fifa")
class Identity {
// private public protected
 protected _courseCount = 1
 
  readonly city:string = "" // it is because it is not inside the constructor
  constructor( public email:string, public  name:string, /*private userId:string*/){}

  private deleteToken(){
    console.log("")
  }

get getAppleEmail():string{
  return `apple${this.email}`
}
 get courseCount():number{
  return this._courseCount
 }
 // a setter can not be void or it cannot have any data types 
 set courseCount(courseNumber){
   if(courseNumber <= 1){
    throw new Error("course count should be more than one")
   }
   this._courseCount = courseNumber
 }
 
 
}
class SubUser extends Identity{
  isFamily:boolean = true
  changeCourseCount(){
   this._courseCount = 4

  }
}
const identity = new Identity ("k@gmail.com","FIFA")

This TypeScript code demonstrates how to create and use classes, access modifiers, properties, getters, setters, inheritance, and methods. Letâ€™s break it down step by step:

1. Class Identity
This is the main class that defines a user identity. It includes various access modifiers (public, protected, private), properties, methods, and constructor logic.

Properties
email (public): A public property initialized using the constructor.

name (public): Another public property initialized using the constructor.

city (readonly):

This property is marked as readonly, meaning it cannot be modified after initialization.
It is initialized directly in the class, not via the constructor. Its default value is an empty string ("").
_courseCount (protected):

A protected property, which means it can only be accessed within this class and its subclasses.
Default value is 1.
Constructor
The constructor takes three parameters:

email (public): This automatically assigns the value to the email property.
name (public): Similarly assigns the value to the name property.
userId (commented out): It is currently commented out, but it was likely meant to store a private user identifier.
Methods
deleteToken (private):

A private method, meaning it can only be accessed within the Identity class.
Its purpose here seems to simulate some cleanup logic (e.g., deleting a session token).
Getters and Setters

Getter for getAppleEmail: Returns a formatted email string prefixed with apple. For example, if email is k@gmail.com, this getter will return applek@gmail.com.

Getter for courseCount: Returns the value of _courseCount.

Setter for courseCount:

Validates the value before updating _courseCount.
Throws an error if the value is less than or equal to 1.
Example:
typescript
Copy code
identity.courseCount = 2; // Valid
identity.courseCount = 0; // Throws error
2. Class SubUser
This class extends (inherits) from the Identity class, meaning it has access to all the public and protected members of Identity.

Properties
isFamily (public):
A new property unique to the SubUser class, with a default value of true.
Methods
changeCourseCount:
Accesses the protected property _courseCount (from the parent class) and modifies its value.
Example:
typescript
Copy code
const subUser = new SubUser("a@gmail.com", "Alex");
subUser.changeCourseCount(); // Sets `_courseCount` to 4
3. Usage Example
typescript
Copy code
const identity = new Identity("k@gmail.com", "FIFA");
Creates an instance of the Identity class.
Initializes email to "k@gmail.com" and name to "FIFA".
Key Concepts Illustrated in Code
Access Modifiers
public: Accessible anywhere.
private: Accessible only within the class where it's defined.
protected: Accessible within the class and its subclasses.
Readonly Properties
readonly city: Can be assigned only once, either during declaration or in the constructor.
Getters and Setters
Getters retrieve property values.
Setters allow validation or customization during assignment.
Inheritance
The SubUser class inherits from Identity, gaining access to its public and protected members.
Error Handling in Setters
The setter for courseCount ensures _courseCount is never set to a value less than or equal to 1.
Example Outputs
typescript
Copy code
console.log(identity.getAppleEmail); // Output: "applek@gmail.com"
console.log(identity.courseCount);   // Output: 1
identity.courseCount = 2;           // Valid
// identity.courseCount = 1;        // Throws Error: "course count should be more than one"

This code demonstrates the use of TypeScript interfaces and their implementation in classes. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

Key Concepts
Interfaces

Interfaces in TypeScript define the structure or blueprint for objects or classes.
Classes that implement an interface must adhere to its structure, i.e., define all the properties and methods specified in the interface.
Classes Implementing Interfaces

Classes can "implement" an interface using the implements keyword.
This ensures that the class provides implementations for all the properties and methods defined in the interface.
Export Statement

The export {} at the bottom ensures this code is treated as a module, avoiding variable name conflicts in a broader application.
Code Walkthrough
Interface TakePhoto
typescript
Copy code
interface TakePhoto {
  cameraMode: string;
  filter: string;
  burst: number;
}
Defines a blueprint with three required properties:
cameraMode (string): The mode of the camera (e.g., portrait, landscape).
filter (string): The filter applied to the photo (e.g., black-and-white, sepia).
burst (number): The number of photos taken in burst mode.
Class Instagram
typescript
Copy code
class Instagram implements TakePhoto {
  constructor(
    public cameraMode: string,
    public filter: string,
    public burst: number
  ) {}
}
Implements the TakePhoto interface.
The constructor accepts all three required properties (cameraMode, filter, and burst) and directly assigns them to the class using public shorthand.
Example:
typescript
Copy code
const instagram = new Instagram("portrait", "vintage", 10);
console.log(instagram); 
// Output: Instagram { cameraMode: 'portrait', filter: 'vintage', burst: 10 }
Class Youtube
typescript
Copy code
class Youtube implements TakePhoto {
  constructor(
    public cameraMode: string,
    public filter: string,
    public burst: number,
    public short: string // Additional property
  ) {}
}
Implements the TakePhoto interface and adds an extra property short.
The class fulfills the TakePhoto requirements while allowing additional functionality beyond the interface.
Example:
typescript
Copy code
const youtube = new Youtube("landscape", "cinematic", 5, "short_video");
console.log(youtube);
// Output: Youtube { cameraMode: 'landscape', filter: 'cinematic', burst: 5, short: 'short_video' }
Key Observations
Interface Enforcement:

Both Instagram and Youtube classes implement the TakePhoto interface and must define all its properties (cameraMode, filter, and burst).
If a required property from TakePhoto is missing, TypeScript will throw an error.
Additional Properties in Classes:

The Youtube class goes beyond the interface by including an extra property, short.
This is perfectly valid because the interface only dictates the minimum structure; additional properties are allowed.
Public Modifier in Constructor:

Using public in the constructor automatically assigns the parameter to a class property, reducing boilerplate code.
What Happens If You Miss a Property?
If a class doesn't define all the required properties from an interface, TypeScript will throw an error. For example:

typescript
Copy code
class Snapchat implements TakePhoto {
  constructor(public cameraMode: string, public filter: string) {}
  // Error: Property 'burst' is missing in type 'Snapchat' but required in type 'TakePhoto'.
}
Final Output Examples:
typescript
Copy code
const instagram = new Instagram("portrait", "black-and-white", 15);
console.log(instagram.cameraMode); // Output: "portrait"

const youtube = new Youtube("landscape", "vivid", 20, "ShortClip");
console.log(youtube.short); // Output: "ShortClip"
Why Use Interfaces?
Consistency: Enforces a consistent structure across multiple classes or objects.
Flexibility: Allows classes to add their unique properties while adhering to a shared contract.
Code Quality: Helps detect errors early during development.
